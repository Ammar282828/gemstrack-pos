# **App Name**: GemsTrack POS

## Core Features:

- Product Management: Stores and manages product information, including SKU, name, category, weights, costs, and a generated QR code. Users can assign items to a customer. Utilizes a Google Sheet backend.
- QR Code Generation & Scanning: Generates QR codes for each product based on its SKU and allows scanning these codes (or manually inputting a SKU) to quickly find and display the product details.
- Jewelry Tag Printing: Create a tag layout and uses a button to generate a printable PDF based on each product. Offers templates that show the item name, SKU, metal weight, and total price.
- Invoice Generation & Printing: Manages the shopping cart for items a customer wants to purchase. Generate invoices with a selected set of items (title, amount, prices) by taking a group of items from the products, and generating the pdf with the invoice and options to save it or print. A tool can decide whether to include shipping costs, promotions, and payment methods, so the generated invoice reflects applicable offers and requirements.
- Dynamic Price Updates: Allows updating the 'Gold Rate per g', triggering an automatic recalculation of all product prices.
